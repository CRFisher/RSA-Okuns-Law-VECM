The aim of this project is to test the short and long run relationship between GDP and unemployment in South Africa. We expect a negative relationship between these variables, with a 4% increase in GDP leading to a decrease in unemployment rate by 1% according to Okun's law. An OLS model and a Vector Error Correction Model will be used to evaluate the relationship.

The data examined is quarterly data from 1995:Q1 to 2019:Q4.

This data was obtained from the South Africa Reserve Bank website: https://www.resbank.co.za
